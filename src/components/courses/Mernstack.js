        <h3>MERNSTACK DEVELOPMENT</h3>

        <p>
        The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that's designed to make the development process smoother. MERN includes four open-source components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. js. These components provide an end-to-end framework for developers to work in.
        With the MERN stack, the developers create URLs, such as application / users / create. On these URLs, they then create, read and modify the data that is stored and retrieved in the MongoDB database. These URLs represent functions, with HTTP calls as the originators.
